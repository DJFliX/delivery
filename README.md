GRPC GUI client for GRPCurl

## What is it?
GUI wrapper for [GRPCurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl)

# What can it do?
Because GRPCurl uses reflection we can auto detect everything. This means you can just click on a method and then fill in the JSON body template and you are done.

## Great, is it done?
Not realy, you might have some limited functionality but it's not ready yet.
